# Python Packer

## Obfuscator source code

Transform python source code into obfuscated python code.

### [PyObfx](https://github.com/PyObfx/PyObfx) (Simple use)

- Obfuscates strings, integers, floats, booleans, variable names, and import names.
- Compress source code (bz2, gz, lzma).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/PyObfx/PyObfx.git && cd PyObfx
pip install -r requirements.txt
python PyObfx.py app.py -p lzma
```

### [PyObfuscate](https://github.com/htr-tech/PyObfuscate) (Simple use)

- Use Marshal for serializing data.
- Use Base16/32/64 for encoding.
- Use Zlib for compression.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/htr-tech/PyObfuscate.git && cd PyObfuscate
python encode.py
```

### [pyarmor](https://github.com/dashingsoft/pyarmor) (Moderate use)

- **Seamless Replacement**: Obfuscated scripts remain as standard `.py` files, allowing them to seamlessly replace the original Python scripts in most cases.
- **Balanced Obfuscation**: Offers multiple ways to obfuscate scripts to balance security and performance.
- **Irreversible Obfuscation**: Renames functions, methods, classes, variables, and arguments.
- **C Function Conversion**: Converts some Python functions to C functions and compiles them into machine instructions using high optimization options for irreversible obfuscation.
- **Script Binding**: Binds obfuscated scripts to specific machines or sets expiration dates for obfuscated scripts.
- The free trial version has some limitations.

```
pip install pyarmor
python -m pyarmor.cli

# Obfuscation Source Code
python -m pyarmor.cli gen app.py
python dist/app.py
```

### [Intensio-Obfuscator](https://github.com/Hnfull/Intensio-Obfuscator) (Moderate use)

- **Replace** all names of `variables/classes/functions/files-name` to random strings with length defined then all chars to their hexadecimal value.
- **Delete** all `comments`, all `spaces lines`.
- **Padding** random `snippets code/functions/classes` with an always differents values.
- Provides a high level obfuscation layer to prevent or delay the reading and understanding of your python program.

### [Phantom-Evasion](https://github.com/oddcod3/Phantom-Evasion) (Advanced use)

Phantom-Evasion is an antivirus evasion tool written in python (both compatible with python and python3) capable to generate (almost) fully undetectable executable even with the most common x86 msfvenom payload.

## Convert to executable

### [pyinstaller](https://pyinstaller.org/en/stable/)

PyInstaller bundles a Python application and all its dependencies into a single package. The user can run the packaged app without installing a Python interpreter or any modules.

- **Ease of Distribution**: One of the primary advantages of PyInstaller is its ability to create self-contained executable files.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: PyInstaller supports cross-compilation, allowing you to create executables for multiple platforms from a single development environment.

```bash
pip install pyinstaller
python -m PyInstaller -F app.py
./dist/app.exe
```

### [nuitka](https://nuitka.net/)

Nuitka translates the Python modules into a C level program that then uses libpython and static C files of its own to execute in the same way as CPython does.

- All optimization is aimed at avoiding overhead, where it's unnecessary.
- Smaller file size

```bash
pip install -U nuitka
python -m nuitka --standalone --onefile app.py
```

### [pyarmor](https://github.com/dashingsoft/pyarmor)

- Packing files into one bundle by PyInstaller, py2exe, py2app, cx_Freeze.
- **Themida Protection**: Protects obfuscated scripts using Themida (Windows only).

```
# Obfuscation Source Code And Packed
python -m pyarmor.cli gen --pack onefile .\app.py
```
