# What is packer?

A packer is a tool that combines an executable file's code, data, and sometimes resources into a single package. It includes code to unpack the program dynamically and execute it, without altering the program's original purpose. 

## What types of packers are there?
It is generally one or a combination of the following operations:[^Packer]

### bundling 
Makes a single executable with multiple files.

- [PyInstaller](https://pyinstaller.org/en/stable/)
- [cx_Freeze](https://cx-freeze.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
- [py2exe](https://www.py2exe.org/)
- [PyOxidizer](https://github.com/indygreg/PyOxidizer)
- [Nuitka](https://nuitka.net/)
- [Briefcase](https://beeware.org/project/projects/tools/briefcase/)

### compression
Compresses the executable to reduce its original size.
- [UPX](https://upx.github.io/)
- [PEtite](https://www.un4seen.com/petite/)
- [MPRESS](https://www.autohotkey.com/mpress/mpress_web.htm)
- [PECompact](https://bitsum.com/pecompact.htm)
- kkrunchy
- [ASPack](http://www.aspack.com/)
### obfuscates
Obfuscates the executable by encodin/gencrypting it.
- ExeCryptor
- ELFCrypt
- [Code Virtualizer](https://www.oreans.com/CodeVirtualizer.php)
- Dotfuscator
- [ConfuserEx](https://mkaring.github.io/ConfuserEx/)
- [xorPacker](https://github.com/tmenochet/XorPacker)
### mutation
Alters the executable's code so that it uses a modifided instruction set and architecture (e.g. using oligomorphism).

- [Hyperion](https://www.kali.org/tools/hyperion/)
- [Molebox](https://github.com/sudachen/Molebox)
- [ASProtect](http://www.aspack.com/asprotect64.html)
- [Enigma Protector](https://enigmaprotector.com/)
- [VMProtect](https://vmpsoft.com/)
### protection
Makes the reversing of the executable harder (i.e. using anti-debugging, anti-tampering or other tricks).

- ExeCryptor
- [Themida](https://github.com/redgate4/Themida)
- [ASProtect](http://www.aspack.com/asprotect64.html)
- [Enigma Protector](https://enigmaprotector.com/)
- [VMProtect](https://vmpsoft.com/)
- [ZProtect](http://www.jiami.net/)

### virtualization
Embeds a virtual machine that virtualizes the instructions of executable files. 
It uses a customized and different virtual instruction set every time to protect your application. 
The virtual machine can be a simple interpreter or a complex virtualization engine, responsible for decrypting and executing the wrapped code at runtime. 
Virtualization technology creates an abstraction layer, hiding the actual instructions and data of the malicious software within the virtual machine, making reverse engineering and detection more challenging.

## What It's Used For?
Malware authors hide their malicious code behind this compression layer. This code is only decompressed and executed after the malware runs (in runtime mode), which helps malware authors bypass static signature-based detection.

1. Increased Difficulty for Static Analysis.
	- Obfuscation: Techniques used to obscure the code's logic and structure, making it harder for analysts to understand.
	- Multi-Layer Packing: Employing multiple layers of packing to further complicate analysis and increase resistance to detection.
2. Bypassing Signature Detection.
	- Changing File Signatures: Modifying the executable's file signature to evade detection by security software that relies on file signatures for identification.
3. Bypassing Behavioral Detection.
	- Sophisticated Techniques: Using advanced methods to bypass behavior-based detection systems that monitor software actions during execution.

By employing these tactics, malicious software authors aim to evade detection by security measures that rely on straightforward identification or behavioral analysis. This layered approach complicates the process for security analysts and software defenses, allowing the malware to operate undetected for longer periods and potentially causing harm to systems and data.


Based on the provided content, here's some additional information supplementing what it cannot achieve:

## What It Cannot Achieve?

1. Complete Evasion of All Antivirus Software.
   - Antivirus software typically employs multi-layer detection mechanisms that may still detect packed and obfuscated malware through heuristic and behavioral analysis.

2. Concealing Dynamic Behavior.
   - Packing primarily provides protection at the static level. Dynamic behaviors during execution can still be detected by behavior analysis and sandboxing.

3. Long-term Concealment.
   - Even if malware can evade detection initially, long-term persistence on a computer increases the likelihood of discovery through regular updates and improvements in antivirus definitions and detection methods.

4. Preventing Advanced Static Analysis Tools.
   - Sophisticated tools like automated reverse engineering tools and dynamic symbolic execution can often analyze packed and obfuscated code to uncover its functionality.

5. Preventing Memory Analysis.
   - Packed programs may employ techniques like "write then execute" at runtime, allowing memory analysis tools to extract the unpacked original program content directly from memory.

6. Evasion of Machine Learning-based Detection
   - Obfuscation techniques may not always successfully mask all features, allowing machine learning-based detection systems to identify patterns indicative of malicious behavior.

These points highlight that while packing and obfuscation provide significant hurdles for security analysts and software defenses, they are not foolproof and can be circumvented or detected through various advanced techniques and continuous improvement in security measures.
