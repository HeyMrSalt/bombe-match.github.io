# Competition Format

!!! warning "Competition format update"

    We now have two modes: Tournament and Challenge. Knockout match has been removed based on user feedback.

## Challenge

In challenge mode, the experience is similar to a CTF (Capture The Flag) contest. Participants compete against our official sample bot, which is equipped with specific techniques. Your goal is to bypass these techniques. You can attempt the challenge multiple times to learn and improve your approach for a particular technique. Unlike the more open-ended development in Tournament mode, challenge mode focuses on overcoming a specific target.

## Tournament

In the tournament stage, participants will be paired with opponents with similar score for the competition. The results of each match will be updated based on the ELO point system. The competition will continue until the end of the event, with medals awarded to the top three participants with the highest score.

<!-- Knockout section has been removed in the new format -->
