# Rules

This competition aims to simulate the offensive and defensive confrontations between malware and Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) systems. Participants can choose to participate as either malware or an EDR system. As the malware, the objective is to successfully steal specific target data and transmit it under the surveillance of the EDR. On the other hand, as the EDR, the goal is to effectively monitor the system and detect any malware lurking within.
