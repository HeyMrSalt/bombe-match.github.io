# Rules for Malware

## Task

Compile all functions into a single Windows EXE executable. The executable should automatically complete all required tasks without user interaction or parameter input. There are three targets to steal in the environment. Steal these targets and upload the answers along with the user ID to the specified location.

## Answer Upload API Location

- API: [https://x.bombe.digitalplaguedoctors.com/submitMalAns](https://x.bombe.digitalplaguedoctors.com/submitMalAns)

This API location can only be accessed within the competition's internal network.

## Answer Format

```json
{
  "answer_1": "Target 1 answer",
  "answer_2": "Target 2 answer",
  "answer_3": "Target 3 answer",
  "secret": "User ID"
}
```

`answer_1`, `answer_2`, `answer_3` can be uploaded separately or together.

Each answer submission must include a secret as user identification.

Each answer can only be submitted once.

## Target Format and Location

- Registry: `answer_1` in `HKCU:\SOFTWARE\BOMBE`
- Encrypted SQLite database: `C:\Users\bombe\AppData\Local\bhrome\Login Data`

```sql
CREATE TABLE logins (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    origin_url TEXT NOT NULL,
    username_value TEXT NOT NULL,
    password_value TEXT NOT NULL
)
```

Decrypt `password_value` with your secret using AES CBC.

`password_value` is a value concatenated by IV (16 bytes) and encrypted password.

`password_value` is in hex format.

- Memory of the specified process: `bsass.exe`

The target name format is: `BOMBE_MAL_FLAG_xxx`, where `xxx` is a combination of 32 digits and letters. There are three answers in total.

## Prohibitions

- Causing a system blue screen (BSOD).
- Destroying the system environment, causing the program to be unable to execute.
- Interrupting network connections.
- Prohibiting actions that close EDR (ATT&CK T1562.001 Impair Defenses: Disable or Modify Tools), including terminating (terminal) and suspending (suspend) EDR.

## Victory Conditions and Scoring Method

- Victory Condition: Find three targets in the environment as answers, submit the answers to the specified API, and not be detected by EDR.
- Scoring Method: Score will be updated using the ELO scoring system.
